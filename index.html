<h1> Natural Language User Interfaces</h1>


</ul><h4><p>We have chosen Natural Language User Interfaces as our topic not only because of its potential to continually benefit humanity but also because of its potential to affect the shape of privacy.  This technology is present in the medicne, mobile phones, and customer service to name a few.  We were also intrigued by of its ease of use, ability to speed up our interactions with computers, and we believe it will continue to be further developed and refined.<p></h4>
