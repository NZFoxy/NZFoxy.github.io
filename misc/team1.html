<h2>Ethical Issues and Reflections – Dan Fox</h2>

<h4><em>Natural language user interfaces continue developing across many platforms.  Using only their natural speaking voice gives the user access to many services including searching the internet for information, dictating to a device, controlling a device, access to services, completing telephone calls, complex medical charting, and even interacting with robots of both the physical and virtual variety.  This technology shows no sign of slowing down as we continue to see it evolve over time.  It was common to have automated attendants that allowed users to use touch-tone in telephony systems to reach the department that they desired, e.g.  press one for billing.  Now, it is much more common to use your voice to select the department that you wish to speak to.  When I contact my current bank, I even authenticate my access using my voice print.  So, what changed, and why has it changed so quickly?  Will the further development of this technology and its benefits outweigh the risks that it poses to us personally and as a collective?
<br><br>

We have adopted natural language user interfaces because they are very simple to use.  It is quite literally as simple as asking for something, and having it occur.  The ease of use paired with the popularity of the interface has caused its use to rise in recent years.  The most common use is in voice assistants, which are programs that run on a smart device that respond to natural language requests, albeit not always with great accuracy.  In my home, I can say “Hey Google, turn on the office lights” or even “Hey Siri, listen to music”.  This saves me from having to get up and turn the lights on or grabbing my phone to select a song to listen to.  I use this technology as a tool for convenience.  However, what could that same technology it does for someone who cannot turn the lights on by themselves?  This ability to control things using your voice when you cannot control them with your body becomes much more important to someone with a physical handicap, giving them a tool that allows them to interact with the world in a way they could not otherwise.  It also offers the ability to easily contact medical services and the freedom to control the environment within their home.  This technology is much more than a convenience to someone who has had their ability to interact with the world changed completely and utterly.
<br><br>

Voice assistants have also been credited with saving lives; A quick search will return many articles about how using the voice assistant on a mobile phone was able to connect the user with life saving emergency services.  One such article tells of an eighteen-year-old man named Sam Ray in the US was saved after being pinned under a truck for around forty minutes, as he struggled to free himself he heard the activation of the voice assistant Siri in his pocket as a result of his movement.  He was able, using his voice, to get Siri to contact emergency dispatch after a few attempts of failed understanding of his request for aid(Chowdhry, 2015).
<br><br>

The potential for this interface is so vast, and benefits to it are so great that we can not stop developing it.  The equalising of access to information and control along with the life-saving nature of this technology show us that we must continue to overcome any risks that it presents to us and develop it further.  Something that is commonly viewed as a convenient but trivial way of interacting with their phone or device could be life-altering and also lifesaving to someone else.
<br><br>

What could go wrong with the development and propagation of this interface in the community?  Security and privacy are often the most common concern when discussing an always on, always listening interface.  A whistleblower stated that contractors working for Apple regularly heard confidential information that was transmitted to Apple when the sound of a zipper was activating the Siri assistant erroneously; The sensitive and private conversations that were inadvertently recorded included criminal dealings, business conversations, and even sexual encounters(Hern, 2019).
Privacy is so important to the wellbeing of humanity that there are laws created to promote and protect an individual’s privacy, as well as to give guidance regarding the handling of a person’s personal information.  Considering what could go wrong, and what has gone wrong with the use of natural language user interfaces, is it worth continuing this technology?  Knowing that an individual’s personal information, or even private conversations of the most sensitive nature could be released to the public, I still say yes it is imperative that we continue to develop this technology and harness its potential to do good.
<br><br>

While an individual does have the right to privacy, I would argue that it does not outweigh the benefits and even equality that this technology offers to others.  To stop developing technology that will create links to handicapped persons at the cost of privacy seems short-sighted to me.  We absolutely need to have regulations and laws in place regarding the safe handling of private and sensitive data.  We also need to ensure that there are appropriate, well-known consequences in place for organisations that mishandle this private data.  However, it is clear to me that if we can incorporate this technology in order to assist those that would not have access to help otherwise, then we must.  The benefits of connecting people to each other, and increasing the overall health of humanity as a whole outweigh the need for strict privacy laws, and potential for harm caused by privacy breaches.
