Jordan: Dan, can you send through the PowerPoint?
<br><br>
Dan: PowerPoint – “As the world…”
<br><br>
Jordan: “As the world grows so does the people’s need for information.”? I don’t know.
<br><br>
Dan: <i>PowerPoint – “Using voice commands to interface with your network of devices is easy, it requires little to no training, and it is intuitive. This is a powerful tool that has quickly branched through the technology world. The widespread adoption has come at a cost, both in manpower and financial burden. Learning a natural language is no easy feat for a computer program, every human has a unique voice, our human languages evolve, and there are so very many dialects in so very many languages. We that the tools to streamline this technology, but what will it cost us as a society? Will the speed and accessibility of natural language user interfaces outweigh the effort that it takes to make this interface more robust? Will privacy disappear forever as our technology starts to listen to us for verbal queues?”</i>
<br><br>
Jordan: I like it
<br><br>
Dan: Think about those two slides over the next couple of days, we'll wait for Theresa's input as well and revise and then submit.
<br><br>
Jordan: So what do we need to read in order to answer the tutorial questions from last week?
<br><br>
Dan: I’m not sure yet.
<br><br>
Jordan: Okay, its now, I think I’ve figured it out.

Theresa: Hey team, I really like what you wrote Dan, I just think it needs a bit more clarity in terms of direction. What concepts are we going with? I can pick out about 4 or 5 different concepts that are all really strong from reading that one slide, should we just pick 1 to lead with and expand on instead? Let me know if I’m wrong btw. If we were putting things in order, I think that last concept about verbal cues seems like a very strong candidate. It’s such a strong concept about privacy concerns that we shouldn’t just be introducing it as we’re ending our points (unless that’s what you were going for then don’t mind what I just said). Hopefully, you get what I mean. Also, my apologies for the late input, I should’ve replied sooner!

Dan: PowerPoint – “Our topic is natural language interfaces, the benefits of using voice commands to easily and intuitively interact with technology. Voice driven technology has captured our interest because it’s already present in our daily lives, however its current state is a mere shadow of the potential it could hold for this generation of computing. This technology is here now with vast room for development. What will the cost of this technology be to society? Will privacy disappear forever as our technology begins to listen to us everywhere for verbal queues?”<br><br>

Dan: Better? If not, let me know exactly what you think we should change, and I’ll edit it.
<br><br>
Theresa: That’s perfect. It’s straight to the point and clear - thank you Dan!
<br><br>
Jordan: Agreed ^
<br><br>
Dan: No diction changes, submit as is?
<br><br>
Theresa: Just quickly, for that last point, is verbal queues meant to be cues or queues? But other than that, I say submit as is.
<br><br>
Dan: That’s the American to NZ translation on overdrive
<br><br>
Jordan: It should be cues. But it’s 100% for me
<br><br>
Dan: Fixed!

Dan: So we do have to select roles. One person should design the slides, one does the research, and one does the website. I would prefer to do the website but will do any role. I need to figure out what we're doing to submit it on this slide before it's due.
<br><br>
Theresa: I don’t mind doing the research but if someone else wants to step in then that’s fine with me. Since you’ve already started entering the details onto the website Dan, maybe it’ll be a good idea for you to continue with it, so all the working and details are on one person’s laptop. Unless Jordan want to do it?
<br><br>
Dan: I figure it will be a group effort for most of it. We’ll all lift where needed. I’ll list it out that way then. Tell me if those titles are too over the top.

Theresa: Hey team, before we submit our slide tonight, are we still changing the names of our roles to fit the grading criteria or are we leaving it as is?
<br><br>
Dan: We need to, but I’m not near a pc
<br><br>
Theresa: I can edit it and then send the PowerPoint through on here? Would you like me to submit it on our behalf tonight or would you like to do it Dan? These are the research topics; Technology Topic is basically just our proposal so that's covered. The topics for research would be Opportunities, Risks, Choices and Ethical Reflections. Although, Ethical Reflections has to be done by all of us individually. This is what Ethical Reflections looks like on the website so we wouldn't really count this as one person's role, but all of us.
<br><br>
Dan: If you could submit that would be amazing. I will research whichever. I’m partial to the Ethical piece, but not married to it.
<br><br>
Theresa: Dan Fox (Team Leader) - Website Design and Technology Opportunities Research Jordan Harris - Data Input and Technology Risks Research Theresa Saolotoga - Technology Choices and Ethical Issues Research - Are these titles too long? I just listed them in the order that they came in from the website. Let me know your thoughts and I'll make the adjustments.
<br><br>
Theresa: Hey team, I'll wait until 11:45pm to submit while I wait for your feedback, if not I'll submit the title of the roles as stated above.
<br><br>
Dan: Perfect

Theresa: Have you started on any sort of research?
<br><br>
Jordan: Some yes, on risks.
<br><br>
Theresa: I'll send through a short bibliography that I gathered for our ethical research. We all have to submit our own personal reflection or something like that. I added in the APA 7th referencing so we all don't have to bother later on.
<br><br>
Jordan: Okay cool, that’s helpful.
<br><br>
Theresa: Did you find out anything cool about technology risks?
<br><br>
Jordan: When I did look it up, it wasn’t so much there were risks, it mostly spoke about positives of the technology however one risk I thought of was a breach of privacy, if the devices we use day to day constantly listen to us.
<br><br>
Theresa: Most of the research that I did on ethics was based around breach of privacy too so maybe we can link the two or connect them. As we end off our points on risks, we can introduce the ethics side of things.
<br><br>
Jordan: I might start looking into devices listening to us and the risks of that.

Theresa: What should I look into for opportunities?
<br><br>
Dan: Maybe you could look at how everyone is trying to develop their own version (of a voice assistant) and there are different ways people are implementing this technology.
<br><br>
Jordan: What about risks?
<br><br>
Dan: We should all try to hit three main pillars.  Perhaps one of yours could be that everyone that has a speaker in their home has a security loophole.   The speakers are always on and always listening.  This is opted in by purchasing the speaker, but voice assistants are opt in by activation.

Jordan: Hey team, I’m currently stumped for a third Risk factor for our topic, I have privacy concerns and reduced human inter action as two risk with references, but I just need a third risk. Any suggestions?
<br><br>
Theresa: You could do the topic that we discussed about different dialects/accents in terms of misinterpretation and accuracy? It's not much of a risk but it's a tedious thing to deal with for most users. Especially if you have to repeat yourself over and over again or need to repeat yourself in a slower and more clear way for the voice recognition device to get it right. <a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/the-disadvantages-of-voice-recognition-software">https://www.techwalla.com/articles/the-disadvantages-of-voice-recognition-software</a> - This link brushes on both Lack of Accuracy & Misinterpretation and Accents & Speech Recognition.
<br><br>
Dan gave a really good example of Mark Zuckerberg doing research on detecting hate speech for Facebook but I had a look into it and it was more AI than voice recognition. I'll paste the link anyways and you can have a read and see if you can make anything out of it. It's a pretty good read - <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-advances-to-better-detect-hate-speech/">https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-advances-to-better-detect-hate-speech/</a>

Jordan: Hey team sorry but what did we need to write by Sunday/Monday?
<br><br>
Dan: <i>Stage Three (Team Project Proposal Presentation): Due: The Project Proposal Presentation is due 05/05/2021 [week 8] Team to present via one [max] PowerPoint slide summarising the proposal and confirming direction of project. The Project Proposal presentation is to be submitted to AUTOnline for Stage 3 files as above. Proposal details and updates can also be posted to your progressively developing Team website, addressing the set of requirements. 10 marks.
Stage Four (Portfolio Progress Review): Due: The Portfolio Progress Review is due in your lab session 19/05/2021 [week 10] Project details and updates can be presented via your Team website, demonstrating how you aim to address the set of requirements for the assignment. 0 marks (but offers chance for feedback and improvement before stage five)</i>.
<br><br>
Dan: We are at Stage 4, where we will have a review of our Portfolio in Lab next week. This means that we need to have all of the sections of our website, so for your section Jordan it will be the Technology Risks Research, your key points typed up. Theresa, these sections are meant to be 1000 words, correct? Or is that our ethical reflections that is 1000 words?
<br><br>
Theresa: I just had a look at the Guideline Conformance Form on the website and it doesn't really specify what the word count is counted towards. So I'm guessing that we each do 1000 words each for our section and then a short reflection maybe for ethics since the max word count is 4500 excluding references. I guess it's up to us how we divide it the word count? I'm not 100% sure sorry.
<br><br>
Dan: Okay perfect, thank you!

Theresa: Hey Dan, do you think 500 words is appropriate to do for each of our sections? If the website is only asking for 3000-4500 words, we still have the Technology/Topic and Ethical Reflections to write out. It'll be 1500 words between us for Opportunities, Risks, and Choices and then another 1500 words for our Ethical Reflections if we do 500 words each - that makes 3000 words now. And then we have Technology/Topic which we can be flexible around since we would have reached the word limit by then. What do you think?
<br><br>
Dan: Let’s do it and see what they say
<br><br>
Theresa: I'm just thinking, if we do 1000 words each for our sections, we'll definitely go over the word limit since we still have our Ethics and Technology Topic to write about. But those are just my thoughts.
<br><br>
Dan: You may be correct. It will be easier to add than to take away I think
<br><br>
Theresa: Yeah, you're right. I'll continue writing my 1000 word section, but I'll write a shorter version to save the hassle in case we might end up needing to cut it down
<br><br>
Jordan: Hey team, just a quick question. How did you all start your writing? I just want a rough start and I should be all good. I'm just having a bit of trouble thinking of how to word the beginning. This is just an opening paragraph of my first risk. Is it in the right direction?
<br><br>
Dan: I have avoided I statements in mine
<br><br>
Jordan: It's from an article I just used to word "states" can you suggest another word?
<br><br>
Dan: Is it a news article or a journal article? The article about the zipper?
<br><br>
Jordan: Yes, and another just about our devices listening to us. If you think it's a poor reference, I can change it and find another
<br><br>
Dan: I read through some of the reference material again and I think it would be best to avoid that type of reference. But we can shoot a message over to the TAs and ask.
<br><br>
Jordan: Thanks Dan, I'll do some research and find better references for the mean time
<br><br>
Dan: I had a look through the library.aut.ac.nz site and found a few that may work, but for now look at the other risks and work on those and then come back to the first. I just want us to have as much as we can ready to go so that in this week's lab we can take the feedback and pivot if we need to.
<br><br>
Jordan: Will do, already started on my second risk, and just need to write out my third risk.
<br><br>
Dan: I’d rather get out in front of it because this project can be onerous if we don't stay on top of it.
<br><br>
Jordan: I found this one, it’s a proper article with a Citation link . It basically looks at the same thing as that zipper article by Forbes
<br><br>
Dan: That’s a good start!
<br><br>
Jordan: I’ll replace the Forbes one with this. Is it okay that my section is less than 500 words?
<br><br>
Theresa: I’m not sure what Dan thinks but, in my opinion, I would say just to write a bit more as a backup, that way when Friday comes and the tutor might say we have to write 1000 words for our sections, at least you have it ready. Just as a precaution though, that's just my opinion. Maybe see what Dan thinks first
<br><br>
Jordan: Thanks for the feedback, I'll get = or > 1000 words for both my research and reflection by Friday
<br><br>
Dan: So, if you get it done by Friday you have to also convert it into html. If you get it done by tomorrow morning, I will put it into HTML for you. As long as the word count is around 470 or so we should be good.
<br><br>
Jordan: Okay, I’ll do my best to have it done tonight for you and I’ll send it through if that’s okay?
<br><br>
Dan: Yup. As long as its tomorrow around 10, I've allocated 4 hours for conversion and figuring out github.
<br><br>
Jordan: No problem I’ll have it done by tonight. I’m pretty much done I just need good references. Hey Dan, so for my third risk talking about honorifics and formalities, do you think it’s okay I use a website as a reference just for that? Or should I use a website?
<br><br>
Dan: Again, not sure. I'll post a message to the TA and ask as soon as I get a chance.

Dan: This is an example of what the site looks like when converted to HTML. It took all night and most of the morning to get it looking good. But the bones are there, now it's tweaking. Changing the colour is a matter of altering two hex codes, so don't worry that part is easy.
<br><br>
Theresa: Wow, it looks amazing Dan! Thank you!
<br><br>
Dan: We can tweak it in the lab on Friday. By the way, I haven't read anything you've submitted. Just put it in. Also, I'm searching for any instances of Natural Language, or natural language and converting them to Natural-Language and natural-language, respectively. It seems that hyphenation is the standard.
<br><br>
Theresa: That makes sense. I think I only added in natural language once or maybe twice in my writing so there shouldn’t be too much to find if that helps.

Dan: Okay, I've got the github working finally! I can add your accounts to it if you'd like to view the html. However, I'll just continue inputting as you update your files to me. This has been updated with our switch of opportunities and choices Theresa.
<br><br>
Theresa: Perfect! Thanks for making the changes Dan. I think I may have gone in the wrong direction with my writing. Do you think I should change it, Dan? I think I focused too much on Voice Assistants rather than natural language user interface as a whole
<br><br>
Dan: As soon as I'm done editing these changes, I'll have a read through everything, and we can go from there. Jordan, I've updated your references and removed all contractions. Please have a look and let me know if you have questions.
<br><br>
Jordan: I’ve just had a read of it now Dan, thanks a bunch for fixing my mistakes. I’ll have my ethical reflection up asap.

Jordan: Hey team, it’s a minimum of 500 words or maximum? Also do we need our own references for ethical reflection?
<br><br>
Dan: All 6 components must be between 3000 and 4500 words excluding references. Also, we have only 3 further references available as we can only use 10-20 references.
<br><br>
Jordan: Can we re-use references for our ethical reflection?
<br><br>
Dan: I have three references in mine, which would mean you’d have to remove a reference from your risks for every reference you add to your ethical reflection. With my reflection, we’re at 20.
<br><br>
Jordan: Okay, we can take a reference out of mine because I'm sure I have a couple too many. I can just use two references in my reflection. 
<br><br>
Theresa: I’m happy to take out some references in my opportunities writing, I think I have close to 10 or maybe even more than that.
<br><br>
Jordan: It should be okay; I'll remove two from mine and I'll add two for my reflections. This is the final up load for my risks research, has 8 references. I’m going to use two new references for my ethics. and reuse another from my risks research. this is my brief ethics contribution. I hope it’s okay, I have two new references. So in total I used 10 references.
<br><br>
Dan: Lol, that's half of the references for a three person project! that's half of the references for a three person project! Leave it with me. Can you both edit the slides that I just shared with you?
<br><br>
Theresa: Do you need me to take out a few references Dan? I’m more than happy to. I can't remember off the top of my head, but did we have to include references in our 3rd slide? I just remember the TA saying something about having the letters as small as possible if we need to in order to make them fit, but I can't find it anywhere on the Assessment Rubric. Oh wait no I found it, my bad.

Theresa: Hey Dan, how are we for word count so far? Would it be possible to use my 1K version for Opportunities instead? I'm trying to fix my 500 word version but I'm finding it difficult to add in important details without going over the 500 word limit. Let me know what you think and if it's not possible, I'll see what I can adjust to my writing.
<br><br>
Jordan: I can remove two from my risks research.
<br><br>
Dan: I’ll do the word count check the need to adjust references in about an hour.<br>
Word Count: 3,304<br>
Theresa - 1055<br>
Jordan – 918<br>
Dan – 1331<br>
I'll put your 1000 word count version in and change the reference list and recount Theresa.
<br><br>
Jordan: Hey Dan, our slide presentation, what do you need me to edit? Or what would you like me to add?
<br><br>
Dan: Add in the risks to page 2 and then we can discuss what we need to change about it when we meet up. Theresa, can I change the first sentence of your Opportunities section to say "There is no doubt".
<br><br>
Jordan: Also, we can all see our changes to the presentation, correct? Are there any more slides we need to add to the presentation?
<br><br>
Dan: I’m not sure if we can. No, it’s three slides only.
<br><br>
Jordan: Okay just making sure, I’ve added to the presentation a little. An extra point in the second and third risks.

Jordan: We can remove 2 of mine
<br><br>
Dan: Revise and send through or we can leave them in and see what happens. Up to you two.
<br><br>
Jordan: I’ll have a look now what I can remove, and I’ll send it through asap. Also, Dan did you count my references inside my reflection as two or one?
<br><br>
Dan: All unique references
<br><br>
Theresa: I’ll have a look through my writing when I get home and I’ll see if I can remove any references
<br><br>
Jordan: Here is my updated version, I’ve removed two references.
<br><br>
Dan: Once I update the reference list, I will be done. I can do quick edits, but no further design will be done on my end. Ensure that you are happy with your writing and submit a final draft to me when you get a chance, and we will do one last edit. I'll put the references into the slide 3 once I have your final drafts and then we're done! If you change your references at all. Very important: If you change your references from the original 9 that you each submitted, please let me know as it has to be changed across multiple sections of the site. I'm happy to do it, but in your final draft let me know what needs by highlighting or some other notation.
<br><br>
Jordan: My submitted one that I sent through just before is my final. I’m happy with all the hard work you’ve done Dan.
<br><br>
Dan: Each reference requires precise html tags, so they're a pain to update.
<br><br>
Theresa: I’ll leave my writing as is so no more drafts from my end.

Theresa: Virtual assistants are at the tip of our fingers, and they are accessible and equipped to help with any sort of task. Examples such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa, Amazon Echo, Google Assistant, Google Home, Microsoft Cortana, and Samsung’s Bixby are all choices and opportunities available to us today. They can be seen in various forms of technology such as built-in software agents for computers and mobile devices, or it can be seen as Bluetooth speakers in the very heart of our homes. There are different ways people are implementing natural language user interfaces, as major tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are constantly competing in acquiring the largest market share. Amazon Alexa have made it easy for individuals with disabilities. Alexa Accessibility assists those with hearing, mobility, speech, and vision difficulties. For those with vision, Alexa can help identify products right in front of you. It’s as simple as holding a can of tomatoes in front of an Amazon Echo Show device and asking, “Alexa, what am I holding?”. By using Amazon Smart Plug, Alexa Accessibility can also help turn on lights, coffee machines, and even open doors for those who have mobility difficulties. There are many more ways that virtual assistants are assisting us today.
<br><br>
Theresa: Hey team, this is what I’m planning on saying today. Do you think I’m touching on the right points or am I going off topic from what’s on the power point slides?
<br><br>
Jordan: I think the first half is good, you’re doing opportunities, right?
<br><br>
Theresa: Yeah, opportunities. I can’t remember if Dan wanted me to touch on disabilities or not but it’s not in the PowerPoint slides
<br><br>
Jordan: I think its very direct about opportunities, so I think it’s good.
<br><br>
Theresa: Okay thanks. Will you be improvising from the PowerPoint, or do you have bullet points written down?
<br><br>
Jordan: Improvising, pretty much just reading off the slides.
<br><br>
Dan: That looks like it’s good to me!
<br><br>
Dan: She said that it should be an image from one of our readings, like a chart.
<br><br>
Jordan: None of my readings have images?

Dan: I managed to turn the project into a website that you can actually visit - <a href="https://nzfoxy.github.io/">https://nzfoxy.github.io/</a>
<br><br>
Theresa: Sweet! Thanks Dan! I just realised the website is due next Friday and not on Wednesday.
<br><br>
Dan: Yeah, I still want to submit soon so that it’s finished. Let me know if you want to remove images or add a different one. I’ll pop the minutes in and submit it.

Theresa: I’ll open up the presentation slides now and input a few bullet points based off my talking points from last Friday.
<br><br>
Dan: That sounds perfect.

Theresa: Should I write out my Opportunities as how we've written the technology topic (i.e. long sentences) or keep it vague and list it as simple bullet points like in the second slide for Risks and Choices?
