<h2>Ethical Issues and Reflections – Jordan Harris</h2>

<h4><em>Arguably voice assistance has become more prevalent, they are also associated with new risks which can create a new form of cyber-attacks for users and the concern of our next generation being more connected through our devices.
<br><br>

Slowly we are seeing in schools’ devices being used more often than having a teacher teaching the children. (Grant, M.M. et al 2015). I believe that in the near future or distant, that we may not even need classrooms and we can gather all our knowledge just by asking our devices any question and within seconds we have the answer. This relates to our risk research talking about we as humans having less and less human interaction as technology evolves.
<br><br>

Moving forward with technology we need to stay vigilant as users, beware of the many things our applications may ask for. Things may advance to asking users verbally through our devices and we would need to verbally respond too. We may be in a conversation with someone, and our devices take our input and activate an agreement we as users are unaware of. This may result in privacy issues that have occurred in the past (Kröger, Jacob & Raschke, Philip. 2019).
<br><br>

My last ethical issue is the communication of information. All our information in the past has come either media news or someone telling us something. Now a days our information is a click away or a spoke phrase away from us. We know Facebook has manipulated data so certain people see certain ads on the website (Flick, C. 2016), but who knows what is next? Will large companies pay millions to have our devices tell us what is true about the media or not? Companies have done it before, what is stopping them in the future? In future we may have large masses of people having heard different news or information about a certain event correctly and other masses of people hear it differently due to their devices and what people have agreed to on their devices.
