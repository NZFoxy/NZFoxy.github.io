<h1>Technology Opportunities – Theresa Saolotoga</h1>


</ul><h4><p>There is no doubt that Voice Assistants are getting more and more popular in this current technological climate. With the increase in products and generations, companies are making voice assistants easier, functional, and more reliable to use. Voice Assistants can be seen in various forms of technology, such as built-in software agents for computers and mobile devices e.g. Apple Siri. Or it can be seen as Bluetooth speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home. Some of the of best manufactures shared in the Voice Assistant Market Report are Amazon Inc., Google Inc., Apple Inc., and Microsoft Corporation, which are all based in the United States of America (Press Release, 2021). These four companies, also known as, “tech giants”, have each produced the world’s most known and mainstream Voice Assistants we know today, such as, Amazon Alexa, Amazon Echo, Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, Google Home, and Microsoft Cortana. These are all examples of natural language interfaces (Bitesize BBC, 2021). In this discussion, I will touch base on the different opportunities that are available to us through natural language interfaces that are Voice Assistants.
<br><br>

Apple’s Siri assistant has been around the longest, which was originally released as an app for iOS in 2010 and then was integrated into the iPhone 4S in 2011. Following Apple’s Siri assistant, Microsoft came out with Cortana in 2013. Amazon then launched Alexa with its Echo-connected home speaker in 2014 (Hoy, 2018a), and shortly after that, Google’s Assistant was launched in 2016 along with its Home Speaker which is connected to the Google app for Android-based smartphones (Hoy, 2018). These are the opportunities available to us today, alongside Samsung’s Electronics (Samsung’s Bixby which is used for Samsung smartphones) who are not too far off from our leading tech giants.

<br><br>

There are different ways people are implementing natural language user interfaces, as major tech giants are constantly competing in acquiring the largest market share (Alepis & Patsakis, 2017a). “Amazon making several variations of its’ Echo product, from their tiny Echo Dot to the Echo Show, which has audio and video capabilities.” (Hoy, 2018b) Google also comes in mini and full sized models which is called Home. And Apple with its Siri-enabled HomePod device entering the home speaker market in 2017. Microsoft is still dedicating their Voice Assistant services and building Cortana into Windows 10 PCs and phones. They have however partnered with Harmon Kardon to develop a Cortana enabled home speaker; Hoy (2018c) explains. Most Voice Assistants are available on smart phones. Siri, which is only available on Apple devices and can’t be downloaded on non-iOS devices, stays loyal to their brand. Hence why Siri is only available on Apple devices such as iPhones, MacBooks, iPads, and the Apple Watch. Google’s Voice Assistant is built into Android phones and can also be “installed as a separate app on the iPhone, although some features are disabled” (Hoy, 2018d). Amazon Alexa has both an Android and iOS app version which you can download, and Hoy (2018e) explains that “Amazon and Microsoft are working together to bring Cortana to Amazon devices and Alexa to PCs.”
<br><br>

The four big companies i.e. tech giants, each have unique features, but all have similar core functions in their Voice Assistant software and devices. Their most popular functions are playing music, setting alarms, controlling smart home appliances, providing weather information, and answering general knowledge questions (Mari, 2019). Apple’s Siri coming out as the Most Popular Mobile Voice Assistant (Reviews.com, 2020) as an in-built and pre-downloaded software on the world’s 1.4 billion active Apple devices (Reviews.com, 2020) have all the main functions a phone should have for essential functionality. Although, Apple’s Siri is in a lane of itself as it is just an extension of a product that you already have, it is locked into Apple’s ecosystem. Whereas other devices such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa are products that you choose to buy to install into your home and will always be listening for cues throughout the day. This is where choices come into play. Whether picking a device to help facilitate your everyday errands with the touch of your hand or choosing to bring into your household, a home assistant that will now become a part of your daily life, the choice is up to you and what is suitable for your life. All products are very skilled voice-based assistants but are all in their own lanes of competition (Khillar, 2020).
<br><br>

Another helpful option for individuals who are physically disabled, is ‘Alexa Accessibility’ through Amazon Alexa. They assist those with hearing, mobility, speech, and vision difficulties. Amazon (2021b) explains that Alexa’s accessibility features are helping people be more connected, more entertained, and more independent. For individuals with hearing difficulties, Alexa can help you choose your preferred speaking rate and closed captioning on Amazon Echo Show devices. For those with mobility matters, Alexa can help turn on your lights, coffee makers, bedroom lamps and even open your door using Amazon Smart Plug. Alexa also helps you order groceries and share shopping lists and much more (Amazon, 2021c). For those with speech difficulties, Alexa gives you the option to do real time text and to call and message without needing to talk. And lastly, individuals with vision difficulties, Alexa can help identify products that are in front of you simply by asking, “Alexa, what am I holding”, on Echo Show devices. Amazon (2021d) calls this, ‘Show and Tell’, where it helps “people who are blind or low vision use any Echo Show to identify common packaged food goods that are hard to distinguish by touch, such as canned or boxed foods… Alexa will provide verbal and audio cues to help you place the item in front of the device’s camera” (Amazon, 2021e). These are useful options for those who have disabilities and are looking for an easier way of accessing things in their everyday life.
<br><br>

Seeing that voice assistants are becoming a part of our daily lives (Alepis & Patsakis, 2017b), we can see we that there are options available to us at the touch of our hands. We have different options to choose from, whether it’s an assistant on your smartphone or Bluetooth speaker in your home helping out where it can. We are surrounded by this technology and it’s up to us whether or not we want it.
