</ul><h4><p>Natural-Language User Interface and It’s Risks

With our given technology I have identified four risks to society and individuals. This risk does vary in severity of risk but nonetheless they are risk.
<br><br>

My first risk and possibly the most severe. Our user faces constantly listening to our voices or any dialog being spoken. There is proven evidence that supports this(Kröger & Raschke, 2019) in this article it states that Apple has apologized for employees listening in on private conversations without consent. Also, another article (References) stating that Apple's Siri voice recognition was triggered by noises not resembling human speech. This is a huge risk to our privacy. Lastly this risk of privacy is not just pointed towards Apple, Amazon's Alexa,  Android's Bixby and Google assistant, all big names in Technology, listening to our private conversations and who knows what they are doing with it.
<br><br>

Moving onto my second risk, which may be a surprise to you, but it is: The further Technology advances, the less human interactions we may occur in our daily lives. (Brodie et al., 2011). To some this may not be a problem or even a thought, but just think for a moment. Today in society we are seeing less and less human interaction because we are too sucked into our phones, texting people and social media. (Andreassen et al., 2016). Look at our supermarkets today, we have seen a decline in manned checkouts, and more self checkouts. What do you think the next step is? It is already here.  Amazon owned supermarkets where you take things off the shelves and walk out, and you will be charged for your items. What is beyond that? It could be that we speak to our phones and all that we ask for has already been packed and ready for us to pick up from the supermarkets. It is a small risk but if you think about it, it affects all of us. (Brodie et al, 2011).
<br><br>

My third risk about Natural Language User Interface and this is the misunderstanding of formalities and offensive translation by devices. If it is hard to understand that is because it is difficult to explain. Essentially it is our devices misinterpreting cultural formalities and potentially causing offense. For example, in cultures such as Japanese culture, it is recommended you call a male 30 years or older than yourself that you refer to that man as "Ossan" or your older sibling as "Oni-San." (Go! Go! Nihon, 2019). These measurements may already be in place, but take New Zealand for example. Google maps pronouncing New Zealand cities and towns may offend others(Easton et al, 2000). This risk looks at a cultural perspective and how a Natural Language interface may affect others culturally.
<br><br>

Lastly my fourth risk is qualitative listening, how our devices can identify a person's voice in a crowded and noisy environment. (Gregory et al., 1997). This can be very common in society today with people constantly using their phones in public. When we use our language interface we want it to respond to our voice and not others. So, the risk of having others' voices and not ours can be a big problem. Imagine you are using your natural language interface and your input is used on another device and vice versa. (Easton et al, 2000). A natural language interface needs to establish a user's voice from a crowd of people. This risk does prove a  challenge for future development and is currently in the works today.
